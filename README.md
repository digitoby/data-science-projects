# data-science-projects
Repository for all of my data science/machine learning projects!

These projects are inspired by my data science course. Using the provided datasets from the course, I turned them into my own explorations and projects to see what I could do.
- [Project 1: Linear Regression](Linear_Regression)
  - In this project, I created a linear model to predict the price of a car. I played with different predictor variables and preprocessing methods to improve model performance. With this dataset, I practiced:
        - Dealing with outliers
        - Relaxing OLS assumptions by manipulating data
        - Using VIF to check for multicollinearity
        - Implementing dummy variables to take advantage of categorical variables
        - Training and testing the linear model
- [Project 2: Property Data Analysis](Property_Analysis)
  - In this project, I leveraged ChatGPT to analyze a property dataset. Using ChatGPT for code, I focused on critically thinking through the analysis to draw conclusions and plan possible next steps. My report is summarized on this [presentation](Property_Analysis/Property_Data_Analysis.pdf)
- [Project 3: Iris K-means Analysis](KMeans_Clustering)
  - In this project, I conducted K-means clustering on the famous iris dataset. I practiced:
      - Scaling data with sklearn
      - Plotting clustered data
      - Implementing the Elbow Method to find the optimal # of clusters
